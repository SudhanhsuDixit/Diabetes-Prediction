# Diabetes Prediction System
# Machine Learning(Random Forest Classifier)
# Streamlit

Description:
1. Uses random forest algorithm to classify whether a person in diabitic or not with an accuracy of 79.95%.
2. Diabetes Dataset was used for training the model, the dataset was sourced from kaggle.
3. The system takes 7 features or parameters as input from the user and then utilizes the random forest algorithm to classify the person as diabitic or non-diabitic.
4. The 8 features are Number of Pregnencies, Glucose Level, Insulin Level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Body Mass Index, Diabetes pedigree function, and age.
